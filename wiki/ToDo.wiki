#summary The to-do list for this project.
#labels Phase-Requirements

== To Fix ==

_If the problem is specific, consider using the issues tracking system._


== To Add ==

*Unit tests for:*
  * Plain text output
  * HTML output
  * SQLite load/dump
  * SQlite regex selection & other SQL operations
  * Pickle load/dump
  * Regex seletion of embedded objects


*Formatting for ToHTML:*
  * Document-defined styles
  * Embedded objects
  * Tables
 

*Diff*
  * In the future, re-implement "track changes" as a diff patch to be included in the ODF file.


*Document templating system*
  * e.g. set up an interface for generating new documents with a predetermined set of styles, including headers, footers etc.
  * Also have an interface for generating reports using this system.


*Nice to have:*
  * Determine document type (in case of wrong filename extension).
  * Clean up styles: If two or more styles have the same attributes, pick one name for all of them and delete the other styles.


*Bob Sutor suggests:*
  * Iterate over a directory of ODF files and print how many of them were authored by a given person. (list file ownership in a friendly format)
