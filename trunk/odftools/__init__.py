""" py-odftools
 
Python library for handling OASIS Open Document Format (ODF) files
This project is a collection of tools for analysing, converting and creating 
ODF files.

The utilities I have in mind are:
- View info about a file or list of files
- Convert to plain text, html or other XML formats, with easy extensibility
- Produce ODF documents from plain text, HTML or other XML sources, with easy 
  extensibility
- Diff and merging of two or more files
